- 👋 Hi, I’m Filip.
- 👀 I’m interested in a hybrid development. But my actual job is in software testing.
- 💡 I know C# from university projects and Python like scripting language from my testing career.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now. I am not ready for collaboration with other programmers.
- 📫 How to reach me? Somewhere and somehow.
